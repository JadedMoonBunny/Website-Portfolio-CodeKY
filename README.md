# Website-Portfolio-CodeKY
## Code KY project
Hey guys, my project for CodeKY is an artist portfolio website. The website will actually showcase some of my own artwork that I have done and of course showcase my junior web dev skills. My website can also fall along the lines of a resume.

When it comes to the features, I plan on having my website utilize

Javascript: A responsive hamburger-style menu
This is on all the webpages.

CSS: A simple hide/show div
This feature will be on the about page.

CSS: A fade in/fade out over hover
This feature is on the home and gallery pages when you hover your pointer over the images.

The sight will also feature a responsive contact form made in Javascript
This feature is on the contact page.

To get the most out of the website and make sure it is functional download the files and open them in Visual Studio Code. If you do not have the extension Live Server, please download it as it will display and run the website.
