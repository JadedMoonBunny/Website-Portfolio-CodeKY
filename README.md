# Website-Portfolio-CodeKY
## Code KY project
Hey guys, my project for CodeKY is an artist portfolio website. The website will actually showcase some of my own artwork that I have done and of course showcase my junior web dev skills. My website can also fall along the lines of a resume.

When it comes to the features, I plan on having my website utilize

Javascript: A responsive hamburger-style menu
CSS: A simple hide/show div
CSS: A fade in/fade out over hover
The sight will also feature a responsive contact form made in Javascript
