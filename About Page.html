    <h2>About The Artist</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Hello, I'm Jade Farmer, a US-based artist currently living in my home state of Kentucky.
         I am a freelance artist who specializes in digital art and illustrations. 
         I have worked as an animator and animation cell colorist in the past and I'm currently learning to be a front stack web developer. 
         A lot of my pieces include fantasy but visually believable, atmospheric paintings 
         while sometimes trying to tell a story in Clip Studio Paint.</p> 
        <br>
      <p>I am a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons and Studio Ghibli films. 
        Video games such as Okami, BloodBorne, Elden Ring, Assassin's Creed,
        and Night in the Woods are really big inspirations to me in terms of art and story direction.</p>
