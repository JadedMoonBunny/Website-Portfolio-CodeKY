# Website-Portfolio-CodeKY
## Code KY project
Hey guys, my project for CodeKY is an artist portfolio website. The website will actually showcase some of my own artwork that I have done and of course showcase my junior web dev skills. My website can also fall along the lines of a resume. When it comes to the features, I plan on having my website utilize:

- Javascript: A responsive hamburger-style menu

- CSS: A simple hide/show div //
This feature is on the about section on the website.

- CSS: A fade in/fade out over hover //
This feature works on the gallery images on the home and gallery page.

- The sight will also feature a responsive contact form made in HTML and Javascript while styled in CSS. //
The javascript contact form works, however, due to minor error the emails end up lost and no where in any of the mail boxes on the host side.


## To get the most out of the website and make sure it is functional download the files and open them in Visual Studio Code. If you do not have the extension Live Server, please download it as it will display and run the website.
